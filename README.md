# Gosal (sal-client)

*Gosal is an alpha project, and should not be considered for production use at this time.  There is no support, pull requests accepted :)*

## Overview

Gosal is intended to be a multi platform client for sal.

## Getting Started

Currently gosal uses a `LoadConfig` funtion that accepts a path, and expects `json`.  For development, its fine to use a path local to the gosal binary/exe.
